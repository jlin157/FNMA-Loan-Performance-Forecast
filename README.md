# Loan-Performance-Forecast
The aim of this project is to develop prediction models for the length of time that FNMA holds a mortgage loan and for predicting foreclosure of a loan, based on information available to FNMA at the time the loan is put on their books. The data used is a portion of the single family loan portfolio for FNMA originating in the second quarter of 2000.
