# Loan-Performance-Forecast
The aim of this project is to develop prediction models for the length of time that FNMA holds a mortgage loan and for predicting foreclosure of a loan, based on information available to FNMA at the time the loan is put on their books. The data used is a portion of the single family loan portfolio for FNMA originating in the second quarter of 2000.

The TRAINING and TESTPARTIAL data sets contain informatio for disjoint sets of loans.

In the training data, the response variables we wish to predict are:

     NMONTHS, the number of months until the mortgage is taken from the books due to foreclosure, prepayment, etc..
     
     FORCLOSED is a boolean variable that indicates whether the mortgage foreclosed (True) or not (False)
